###Startup for CS 260 winter 2025

##Elevator Pitch
my app will be tailored to young families like my own who need to save money and keep track of epenses. The users will be able to log in as a member of a family and view and edit goals and expenditures. This will allow both spouses to be equal partners in managing money, as well as viewing progress toward joint goals. The main attraction of this app will be the graphical representations of spending habits: a progress bar toward goals (eg: "your restaurant date fund is half full. Keep it up!"), encouraging updates designed to incentivize frugality (eg: "your spending on car parts is down 20 percent from last month. Way to go!") and a pie chart of spendig based on category.
