## HTML notes
* the table format will be useful for my transaction list.
* I can use <img> for the pie chart (and I can updat it by accessing
a foreign API)

## CSS Notes
* while I thought the table in html would be helpful, I ended up just using `<div>` and the grid template in CSS instead
* flexbox is incredibly helpful for keeping all content aligned and presentable on different screen sizes
